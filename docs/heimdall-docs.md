# heimdall

Homelab services VM — the home for stateful self-hosted services, replacing the old Talos
k8s cluster. Runs on Proxmox host `hella` (the remaining Proxmox node since `thor` was
decommissioned). Storage lives on `odyn`, the TrueNAS box.

> Renamed from `nix-services` during a clean rebuild — the old VM's network stack was
> corrupted by a VLAN re-IP and was unrecoverable. Same role, same static IP, same NFS
> data (the data lives on odyn, so nothing was lost). See
> [`build-notes/HEIMDALL-BUILD.md`](build-notes/HEIMDALL-BUILD.md) for the build/handoff brief.

## Specs

- **Hostname:** `heimdall`
- **Host:** Proxmox node `hella`
- **IP:** `10.0.20.17` (static, baked into the NixOS config; outside the VLAN 20 DHCP pool)
- **Resources:** 6 vCPU / 16 GB RAM (likely over-provisioned for current load — could trim)
- **OS:** NixOS 26.05 (flake-managed; `stateVersion = "25.11"`)
- **Workloads:** mix of native NixOS services (Traefik, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki) and
  Podman containers (Immich, Nextcloud, Crafty, Paperless, Homepage)

## Storage — odyn (TrueNAS)

All persistent data is on `odyn` at `10.0.20.6`, ZFS pool `vault`, mounted over NFS. See
`hosts/heimdall/modules/system/nas.nix`. Key mounts:

```
10.0.20.6:/mnt/vault/immich                             → Immich photos (dedicated dataset,
                                                          700 root:root, export heimdall-only)
10.0.20.6:/mnt/vault/nextcloud                          → old Nextcloud files (ro; service
                                                          removed 2026-07-17, data retained)
10.0.20.6:/mnt/vault/nfs-pvc-kubernetes/crafty/*        → Crafty config/backups/servers/…
10.0.20.6:/mnt/vault/nix-services                       → service data (dataset kept its old name)
```

> The `/mnt/vault/nix-services` dataset on odyn keeps its original name even though the host
> is now `heimdall` — renaming the host doesn't rename the NFS export. Local mount stays
> `/mnt/nas/nix-services` (grafana backups + paperless base live under it).

## Services running

Routes are defined in `traefik.nix`; all are `*.oryxserver.org` behind the wildcard cert.
Exact subdomains live in that file — the pattern is `<service>.oryxserver.org`.

| Service | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Traefik | native | reverse proxy + dashboard (`api@internal`), wildcard TLS |
| Immich | podman | photos; data on odyn NFS (`vault/immich` dataset) |
| Crafty | podman | Minecraft server controller |
| Paperless | podman | document management |
| Homepage | podman | dashboard / landing page |
| Grafana | native | monitoring dashboards |
| Prometheus | native | metrics scraping |
| Loki | native | log aggregation (promtail currently commented out) |
| postgres-exporter | native | Postgres metrics |
| blackbox-exporter | native | HTTPS probes |
| Nexterm | podman | SSH/remote-access manager |
| Scrutiny | native | drive health (collector runs on odyn, pushes here) |
| Odyn UI proxy | route | `https://truenas.oryxserver.org` → `https://10.0.20.6` (insecure transport) |

`default.nix` does NOT import `configuration.nix` (that would pull in the desktop). It
cherry-picks the shared modules it needs (`boot`, `locale`, `nix`, `users`, `tailscale`)
and adds the service modules above.

## Wildcard cert (Let's Encrypt + Cloudflare DNS-01)

Cert at `/var/lib/acme/oryxserver.org/`. Auto-renews via systemd timer.

- **Domains:** `oryxserver.org`, `*.oryxserver.org`
- **DNS-01 token:** `/var/lib/secrets/cloudflare-dns-token` (`CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN=...`)
- **No port forwarding** — DNS-01 doesn't need port 80
- The wildcard covers any new subdomain automatically (e.g. you could move the odyn proxy to
  `odyn.oryxserver.org` with just a Pi-hole record — no new cert needed)

## Adding a new service

1. Write a Nix module if it's a container.
2. Add a Traefik router + service in `traefik.nix`.
3. Add a Pi-hole DNS entry: `<service>.oryxserver.org` → `10.0.20.17`.
4. Push, pull on the host, rebuild.

See [`deploying-services.md`](deploying-services.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Migration history

### Immich (from k8s, 2026-04-29)
- pgvecto-rs Postgres + Redis + immich-server; 7,337 assets restored from `pg_dump`.
- Photos on odyn NFS at `/mnt/vault/nfs-pvc-kubernetes/immich/upload`.
- ⚠️ **ML backend was on `nix-oryx` (`10.0.0.15`) — now decommissioned.** The
  `IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_URL` is commented out in `immich.nix`, so smart search / face
  detection are off until ML is re-hosted on the new NixOS AI box (to be configured from
  mjolnir, like heimdall) and re-pointed.

### Nextcloud (from k8s 2026-04-29; REMOVED 2026-07-17)
- Ran postgres:16-alpine + redis:alpine + nextcloud (last version: 33.0.6).
- **Removed 2026-07-17** — replaced by Immich for photos. Files retained read-only on odyn
  at `/mnt/vault/nextcloud` (Photos = 17G); DB dump at
  `/mnt/nas/nix-services/db-backups/2026-07-17/nextcloud-pgdumpall.sql`; local DB dir
  `/var/lib/nextcloud-db` left in place as extra safety.

## Common operations

```bash
# pull + apply
ssh christina@10.0.20.17
cd ~/nixos-dotfiles && git pull origin main
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#heimdall

# restart one container
sudo systemctl restart podman-<container-name>

# logs
sudo podman logs <container>
sudo journalctl -u podman-<container> -f

# occ inside Nextcloud
sudo podman exec nextcloud-server su -s /bin/bash www-data -c "php /var/www/html/occ <command>"

# manual cert renew (rarely needed)
sudo systemctl start acme-order-renew-oryxserver.org.service
```

## Known gotchas

- **`oc_admin` not in pg_dump:** `--no-owner --no-acl` strips roles. Recreate with
  `CREATE USER oc_admin WITH PASSWORD '...'` (password is `dbpassword` in `config.php`),
  then `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO oc_admin;`.
- **Traefik dynamic config:** routers/services/middlewares go in `dynamicConfigOptions`,
  not `staticConfigOptions` (that's entryPoints only).
- **ACME `environmentFile`:** must be on the cert itself, not in `defaults` (the `defaults`
  block doesn't propagate to `acme-order-renew-*.service`).
- **Odyn backend has a self-signed cert:** Traefik needs
  `serversTransports.insecure.insecureSkipVerify = true` to accept it.
- **Nextcloud `trusted_domains`:** reachable via `https://nextcloud.oryxserver.org` only;
  `http://10.0.20.17:8081` is rejected.

## Decommissioned dependencies (cleaned up in the heimdall rebuild)

`thor` (Proxmox node) and `nix-oryx` (its AI VM, `10.0.0.15`) are gone. Their references were
removed during the rename:

- `prometheus.nix` — dropped the `thor` (`10.0.0.2`) and `nix-oryx` (`10.0.0.15`) node
  targets and the GPU-metrics job.
- `homepage.nix` — removed the `Intelligence` section (Open WebUI / ComfyUI / nix-oryx /
  Model Lab tiles) and the `Proxmox Thor` tile.
- `traefik.nix` — removed the `openwebui` and `comfyui` routers + services.
- `immich.nix` — ML URL commented out (see Migration history above).

These AI workloads are slated to return on a new NixOS **AI box**, configured from mjolnir
the same way heimdall is.
